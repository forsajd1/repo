Synopsis
========

This is a metadata add-on for [Kodi/XBMC](http://kodi.tv/) which scrapes movie information from [csfd.cz](http://www.csfd.cz/).

Background
==========

Version 3.3 of metadata.csfd.cz scraper is few years old from [LD developer](http://ldevel.blogspot.sk/). As there are no official updates for few years (only some vaguely documented unofficial fixes available on the forums), I have decided that I will take the last available version 3.4h and modify it for my personal use. I have ended up rewriting almost whole logic from the scratch with minimal changes to original features. So as it is more like continuation of the scraper, I have decided to go public with version 3.5 rather than fork a new one.

Installation
============

1. Download the [original version](https://github.com/ekarorgit/metadata.csfd.cz/archive/master.zip).
2. In Kodi, navigate to *Add-ons* > *Add-on browser* > *Install from zip file*. [help](http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_add-ons_from_zip_files)
3. Browse for the downloaded zip file and click *OK*.

Compatibility
=============

All Kodi/XBMC versions starting from XBMC 11 "Eden" are supported.

Disclaimer
==========

Feel free to report any issues with the scraper, though I don't guarantee that requests will be heard in prompt time.
